    Loads accept ``.ca``, ``.cg``, ``.cs``, and ``.cv``; stores accept
    ``.wb``, ``.cg``, and ``.cs``. The empty string selects the default.
    Load ``.cg``/``.cs`` and store ``.cs`` select LLVM non-temporal memory
    operations. Load ``.cv`` additionally selects a volatile operation.
    Load ``.ca`` and store ``.wb``/``.cg`` are aliases for default caching.

    These modifiers use the HCU compiler's global-memory path. Load
    ``.cg``/``.cs`` constrain the address to vector registers to preserve
    cache controls when LLVM would otherwise scalarize a uniform load.
    This can increase address register use or require register moves.
    They do not promise NVIDIA cache-level semantics. Descriptor copies,
    eviction priorities, and store ``.wt`` are unsupported. Copy
    synchronization is unchanged. Other HCU targets are rejected until
    separately validated.
