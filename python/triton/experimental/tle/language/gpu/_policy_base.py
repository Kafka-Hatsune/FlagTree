"""Shared contract for native per-access cache policies.

Every backend policy declares which instruction family it belongs to and which
copy paths and directions it supports. The base class turns those declarations
into uniform validation, existing cache/evict enum controls and constexpr
specialization, so a backend only has to describe its own native fields.

A policy never implies portable semantics across backends and never changes
synchronization or visibility.

class NativeCachePolicy:
    """Base class for the per-access policies exported under ``tle.gpu``.

    Subclasses are frozen dataclasses. They declare:

    ``backend``
        Compilation target that accepts this policy.
    ``kind``
        Native instruction family, used for diagnostics; the formal cache/evict
        values select the lowering.
    ``paths`` / ``directions``
        Which copy forms accept the policy at all.
    ``copy_only``
        True for tensor-copy modes that have no meaning on an ordinary
        ``tl.load``/``tl.store`` even though ``tle.gpu.copy`` lowers them
        through the same pointer path.
    ``modifiers``
        Optional per-direction tuple of accepted cache modifiers. When present,
        the base class validates ``self.cache_modifier`` against it.

    Subclasses implement :meth:`to_ir` for native multi-field controls and may
    override :meth:`check_access` for other access constraints.

    Default construction follows one rule: an all-default policy object is
    legal exactly when it still says something that omitting ``cache_policy``
    does not, namely "this access is explicitly governed and keeps the
    validated native memory path". HCU, PPU, MThreads LSU and TME accept it
    for that reason; their empty value selects the native default while
    pinning the path. Two backends reject it, and both say so in their own
    error: NVIDIA, because a hintless NVIDIA policy selects exactly what an
    omitted ``cache_policy`` already produces, and MetaX, because its SDK
    lowering is named after the modifier and has nothing to emit for an
    empty one.
